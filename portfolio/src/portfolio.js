  description:
    "I was born in Columbus, OH, and moved to Venezuela at two years old. While living in Venezuela, I had the opportunity to experience the culture and grow up in a different environment. While studying Civil Engineering there, I had a C++ class that made me realize I enjoyed programming and that software development is my calling. After moving back to Columbus, I joined the US Army and served for seven years on active duty. In 2020, I transitioned from active duty and currently serve in the Reserves while also taking on roles in coaching and leadership. I enjoy playing video games, watching movies, and traveling.  ",
